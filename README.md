# This is a project that will recommend us anime tv shows based on what we previously watched. You can find a lot of datasets online about movie reviews or anime reviews which you can use these codes. It bases the recommendation on the % of similarities of the anime and takes that similarity into account when it recommends it to you. We will also use clustering that will group the animes and tell us what is the keyword occurances. Also Clustering algorithms examine text in documents, then group them into clusters of different themes. That way they can be speedily organized according to actual content. Thank You!
